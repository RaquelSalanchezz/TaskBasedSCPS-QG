# Task Based CPS Planning Quantitative Guarantees under Multiple Sources of Uncertainty

## Abstract
In smart Cyber-Physical Systems (sCPS), planning under uncertainty is a complex challenge addressed through approaches that handle various constraints and uncertainty sources, such as models, environment, sensing, or the temporal availability of components. These methods often (i) address each source of uncertainty separately, (ii) use scalable techniques like genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning, though without guarantees of success, or (iii) employ methods like probabilistic model checking, which provide quantitative guarantees but are not easily scalable.

This paper introduces a method for task-based CPS planning that combines genetic algorithms with statistical model checking to generate scalable plans offering quantitative guarantees under defined levels of uncertainty from multiple sources. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses a state-of-the-art uncertainty-aware genetic algorithm baseline, delivering stronger assurances of meeting system objectives with a modest increase in computational cost.
